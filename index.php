			<p>Thanks for visiting! This was a small project I put together after repeatedly seeing people on Facebook asking if there was any way to mass-download all of their images from Bebo after all the recent talk of the website being closed down.</p>
			<p>The process is fairly simple, click step one, you'll be prompted to login to Bebo.com if you're not already. Then you'll be prompted to authorize this app ... then you'll be shown a list of your images from all available albums. Then just come back here, paste in the list ... and hey presto ... zip file with all your Bebo Profile images!</p>
			<p>There are a few possible improvements which could be made, automatically pulling the list back to this site for a start ... and who knows, maybe even an extra step to upload the images to Facebook for you (that's what you're going to do, right? ;) )... that's for another day though :)</p>
			<p>Enjoy the app, I hope it works for you, if it doesn't, email me at johnathan [at] weleasewodewick.com with the details and I'll take a look</p>

			<p>This code is stupidly straight forward, if anyone feels like contributing and expanding the site with me (presuming there is <i>any</i> demand at all ... let me know :)</p>
